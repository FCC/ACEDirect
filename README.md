Accessible Communications for Everyone (ACE) Direct is a Direct Video Calling (DVC) platform that enables direct calling from deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to an American Sign Language (ASL)-trained agent within an organization's call center. The agent handles the call using a video-capable phone with real-time video connection. To demonstrate the capabilities of DVC, the FCC and CAMH have further advanced the original auto-routing POC into a call center platform for two to ten customer service representatives.
